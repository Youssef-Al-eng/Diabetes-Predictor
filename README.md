# Diabetes Predictor 🌟

## Overview
This project predicts diabetes using **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** and **Random Forest** models.  
It is designed to be professional, fully reproducible, and includes:

- Data visualization for insights
- Feature importance analysis for both models
- Model comparison (accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC)
- Prediction probability for custom inputs
- Interactive workflow in a single **Google Colab Notebook**

This makes it easy for anyone to run, understand, and experiment with the models.
